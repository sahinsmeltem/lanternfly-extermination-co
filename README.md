# lanternfly-extermination-co.
In a lovely spring afternoon, you get yourself a cup of coffee and a book, looking for somewhere to sit on the grass...
Oh no! Lanternflies get ahead of you!!! And there are so many of them!!! HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELP!
You need a professional.
Allow me to introduce: LANTERNFLY-EXTERMINATION CO.

# GAME STARTES!

You play as a experienced lanternfly stomper, and your work starts in Spring.

- How to kill a laternfly
Move mouse to hover over and aim the laternflies, press 'space' to stomp.

- A perfect stomp kills, an imperfect stomp hurts.
A perfect stomp would happen when you stomp the lanternfly in the front part of your shoe; if you stomp them with other parts of your shoe, you just hurt them, it will take several imperfect stomps to kill them.

- Kill them quickly!
The lanternflies can grow up with seasonal change. They start young, with closed grey wings. After 3 seconds, they become mature, and now they can mate and reproduce a young lanternfly when they overlap with each other. (Oh no! there are more of them now!!!) They would be naturally dead after 10 seconds.

- Winter is coming
If you managed to kill them all before winter comes, you win! Bravo! You earned reputation for your company! Othwise, if there is even one of them existing when winter comes, you loss; Or in any moment, if there are 30 of them, you also loss.
